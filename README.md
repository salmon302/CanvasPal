## Priority Algorithm

CanvasPal uses a sophisticated algorithm to prioritize assignments:
```
Priority = (Due Date Factor * Due Date Weight) +
          (Grade Weight Factor * Grade Weight) +
          (Impact Factor * Impact Weight)
```
Where:
- Due Date Factor = 1 - (Time Remaining / Total Time)
- Grade Weight Factor = Assignment Weight / 100
- Impact Factor = Potential Grade Impact / 100
